the base noun phrases are distinguished by brackets. Some samples are listed.
1. /VV	/AS NP ( (/NR	/NN)
/DEG NP(/JJ	/NN)/NN)
2. ( /DT /M	/NN )	/VV /AS
(	/NN	/NN) /DEG ( /JJ
/NN)
There are two and three base noun phrases in sentence 1 and sentence 2 respectively.
(2). Chinese full parsing
Following sentences are the results of Chinese full parsing.
1. VP (VP (/VV	/AS) NP ( NP ( (
/NR	/NN )	/DEG NP (	/JJ
/NN ) ) )
2.IP ( NP (/DT /M /NN ) VP(VP( /VV /AS) NP ( NP (/NN/NN /NN) /DEG NP (/JJ /NN))))
In order to display the parsing result clearly, sentence 2 is showed in the tree bank format.
IP (NP ( DT
M
NN )
VP (VV
AS
NP ( NP ( NN
NN )
DEG
NP ( JJ
NN )))

Table 5 is the results of these types of parsing.
The experimental results show that our parsing algorithm, extended GLR parsing algorithm, is efficient to both Chinese baseNP parsing and full parsing.
5. Conclusions
In our system, we present the extended GLR parsing algorithm that is based on the Tomita’s GLR algorithm. A new grammar system PCFG*
based on PCFG is proposed to describe the grammatical rules that are added probability and frequency attributes. So our parsing system combines Chinese grammar phenomena with statistics distribution. This is feasible and efficient to implement Chinese shallow parsing and full parsing. In the future task, we further improve the efficiency and robust of our parsing algorithm and expand Chinese grammatical rules with both statistical attributions and language information. It is important to utilize the results of base noun phrases identification and to improve the precision of Chinese full parsing. Acknowledgements
