Compilation

Use Eclipse (if you have problems, use Google or ask 
a classmate who attended the lab for help)


Familiarize yourself with Naive Bayes
===

(1) Look at ml.classifier/vote.arff... what does it contain?

(2) Look at ml.classifier/vote_sparse.arff... specifically the
    last six lines... what is different from (1)?  Could the entire
    file be encoded this way?  What would be the advantage?

(3) Run ml.classifier.naiveBayes.main()... what is it showing you?
    How well is it doing?


Get Naive Bayes working with new text data
===

(4) Look at the data in the data/ directory... there are three different
    subdirectories, what is in each?  What could be features?  What could
    the class be?
    
(5) Look at text.UnigramBuilder.main()... what does it load, what does it
    build?  What happens when you change the parameters?
    
(6) Look at text.ArffDataBuilder... you will use this to construct an ARFF
    file from the raw data.  There are two points marked TODO... fill
    them in with the required code.
    
(7) Run the code... it should dump a file in the ml.classifier directory.
    Change NaiveBayes.main() to load this new file (it is currently 
    commented out).  Does the code run?  How well does it do?

(8) Run the code again... do the results change?  Why?  Look at main()
    for hints.

(9) How does training performance most often compare to test performance
    across different runs?  Why? 

(10) Experiment with ArffDataBuilder... try changing the number of 
    words used.  Also try turning stop word removal on and off with
    the same number of word features.  How do these changes affect
    the performance (running time / accuracy)?

(11) Switch the ArffDataBuilder.DATA_SRC to "newsgroups" rather than
    "two_newsgroups".  Now we're doing multiclass classification.
    How does NaiveBayes perform?  Is this good for eight classes?
    
(12) One can still do a lot better with Naive Bayes by continuing to
    tweak it.  Just Google for "naive Bayes newsgroups" and you should
    find plenty of papers providing improvements.  Identify at least
    one additional enhancement you can make to Naive Bayes.
